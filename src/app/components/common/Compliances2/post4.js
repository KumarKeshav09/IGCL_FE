                    POSH Compliances refers to the legal obligations outlined in
                    the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,
                    Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. This legislation aims
                    to create a safe and respectful work environment for women
                    by preventing and addressing instances of sexual harassment.
                    POSH Compliances encompasses a range of measures, including
                    the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs),
                    employee awareness and training programs, and the
                    implementation of effective grievance redressal mechanisms.
                    Adherence to POSH Compliances is crucial for organizations
                    to foster a culture of gender equality, respect, and dignity
                    in the workplace while mitigating legal risks associated
                    with sexual harassment incidents.
